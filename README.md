# network-simulation-labs

Documentation of my Netwokring Training covering key concepts, hands-on labs, and troubleshooting practices.

This repository documents my **Networking Internship** experience, where I learned and practiced essential computer networking concepts through daily notes, lab exercises, and troubleshooting activities.

##  About the Repository  

-  **Week-by-Week Documentation:**  
  The entire internship is divided into weeks. Each week focuses on a specific set of networking topics such as OSI Model, IP Addressing, Routing, VLANs, NAT, and more.  

-  **Day-Wise Learning Notes:**  
  Every folder includes day-by-day notes describing what I learned, including definitions, explanations, and real-world examples to strengthen conceptual clarity.  

-  **Concept Understanding:**  
  Each topic covers the core networking fundamentals with short and easy-to-understand explanations. Concepts include both **theory** and **practical implementation**.  

-  **Hands-On Lab Exercises:**  
  Along with notes, I performed practical labs using simulation tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
  These labs helped in understanding real-time device configurations such as routers, switches, and VLANs.  

-  **Troubleshooting Practices:**  
  The repository also includes examples of common networking issues and troubleshooting commands used to fix configuration errors and connectivity problems.  

-  **Visual Learning (Images & Diagrams):**  
  Each topic is supported with **diagrams, screenshots, and images** to make the learning process more interactive and visually clear.  

-  **Purpose of the Repository:**  
  The main goal of this documentation is to combine **theoretical learning** with **practical networking experience**, making it useful for students, beginners, and anyone preparing for certifications like **CCNA**.
